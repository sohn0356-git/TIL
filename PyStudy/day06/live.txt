God will make a way
Where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see
He will make a way for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely to his side
With love & strength for each new day
He will make a way
He will make a way
God will make a way
Where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see
He will make a way for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely to his side
With love & strength for each new day
He will make a way
He will make a way
By a roadway in the wilderness
He'll lead me
Rivers in the desert
Will I see
Heaven & earth will fade
But his word will still remain
& He will do something new today
God will make a way
Where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see
He will make a way for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely to hisâ€¦
